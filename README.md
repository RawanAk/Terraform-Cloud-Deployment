This page describes the advanced topic of constructing a URL for Deploy to Oracle Cloud button.

When properly linked, this button provides a direct option for your users to create stacks with your Terraform configuration.
This image shows the Deploy to Oracle Cloud button.


This button takes a user directly to the Create Stack page in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console. The button is linked to a Terraform configuration file package that you specify, so the Terraform configuration is already selected for the user when they create the stack. You can store Terraform configuration files in a supported provider.
