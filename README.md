This page describes the advanced topic of constructing a URL for Deploy to Oracle Cloud button.

When properly linked, this button provides a direct option for your users to create stacks with your Terraform configuration.
This image shows the Deploy to Oracle Cloud button.

<a
href=”https://cloud.oracle.com/resourcemanager/stacks/create?zipUrl=<package URL> "target=”_blank”><img
src=”https://oci-resourcemanager-plugin.plugins.oci.oraclecloud.com/latest/deploy-to-oracle-cloud.svg"alt=”Deploy to Oracle Cloud”/>
 </a>
 
 
This button takes a user directly to the Create Stack page in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console. The button is linked to a Terraform configuration file package that you specify, so the Terraform configuration is already selected for the user when they create the stack. You can store Terraform configuration files in a supported provider.
